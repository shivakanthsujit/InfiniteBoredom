# InfiniteBoredom
### Describes your state of mind as you play the app

This is my second attempt at Android App Development , the first being PayUp. As you can see both of them are pretty simple , some would say boring apps.
And you wouldn't be wrong at all. These were made as part of a learning process. And as such would obviously be shitty.

Now , does that mean my App Development skills are going to radically improve ? God knows.

But hope springs eternal
